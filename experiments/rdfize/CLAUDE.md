We are building functionality for semantic lift of structured data to RDF.
It is similar in scope to RDF Mapping Language (RML),
but we are using Clojure so that we can describe advanced transformations in proper code.
We stil want to have concise helpers and describe transformations as declaratively as possible.

Explore code in following paths if needed to understand how the libraries work:
./tmp/rudolf for RDF utilities, working with IRIs and literals
./tmp/raphael for parsing turtle files

Run tests after change with `clojure -M:test`
